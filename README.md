<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Stock News Sentiment Analysis
This project scrapes and uses data from a stock news website, "https://finviz.com/" using BeautifulSoup library. It then performs sentiment analysis on news headlines regarding stocks using nltk.vader and visualizing the data with matplotlib and pandas. This data is then plotted against stock prices retrieved from yfinance, and compares whether news headlines had a impact on the ticker price of the analyzed stocks. <br /> <br /> Idea inspired from Project inspired by Damian Boh's [post.](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/sentiment-analysis-of-stocks-from-financial-news-using-python-82ebdcefb638)
